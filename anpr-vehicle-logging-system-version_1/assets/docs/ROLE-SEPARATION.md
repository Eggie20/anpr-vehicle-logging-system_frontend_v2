## File Organization

Each role has isolated assets:

```
/css/{role}/
/js/{role}/
/images/{role}/
/components/{role}/
```

Shared assets live in `/shared/` directories.

## Adding a New Role

1. Create CSS file: `/css/{role}/{role}.dashboard.css`
2. Create JS file: `/js/{role}/{role}.dashboard.js`
3. Create HTML page: `/pages/{role}.html`
4. Add link to `index.html` portal cards
5. Add mock user data to `mock-api.js`
